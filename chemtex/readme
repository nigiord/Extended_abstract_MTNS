INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE USE OF THE CHEMICAL STRUCTURE TEX MACROS
AND THE TEX SOURCE FILES WITH DOCUMENTATION:

File macros.tex contains all the macros.  The other files are also TeX
source files and contain instructions and other useful information.
The files called chap*.tex are chapters from my thesis.  Files
appdb.tex and appdc.tex contain information on numeric values of
coordinates in the structure diagrams and on slopes possible in LaTeX,
respectively.

To run a file like chap5.tex through TeX/LaTeX, you first have to look
at the \input statements at the beginning of the files and make sure
that these files are in your directory.  The easiest way to include
ALL macros would be a statement \input {macros.tex}.  Since I could
not do that on our system because of TeX memory limitations, I had to
put individual macros (or groups of macros) into separate files and
use statements such as \input{purine.tex} where file purine.tex
contains the macro (\newcommand) called purine.  Separate files such
as purine.tex are not part of the files sent to you now; you would
have to cut them out of macros.tex if necessary.

The macros called initial and reinit are always needed when the
chemical structure macros are used.
