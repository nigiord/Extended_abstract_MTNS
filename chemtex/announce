Subject: TeX/LaTeX chemical formula macros

As promised, here are the chemical structure formula macros.  These
macros are described in

@ARTICLE (
 author = "Roswitha T. Haas and Kevin C. O'Kane",
  title = "Typesetting Chemical Structure Formulas with the Text 
           Formatter \TeX/\LaTeX",
journal = Computers \& Chemistry
   year = "1987",
 volume = "11",
 number = "4",
  pages = "251--271" )

I did not have anything to do with writing the macros, but have been
given permission to distribute them by one of the authors:

There is a significant amount of documentation that goes along with
the macros -- all together about 200k in macros and docs.

Let me know if you have any trouble unpacking the macros, or something
gets lost along the way.

Also, to Luis Soltero and Rick Gray:  Thanks for the offer to archive
the macros.  If you do end up putting them somewhere for anonymous
ftp, how about posting a note to the net?

I offered them to the Clarkson archive a while back, but I don't think
they were ever made available.  Apparently the manager of the
collection wanted a much shorter (?) documentation file.  As I am not
the author, I don't think it is really appropriate for me to chop up
the documentation.  In any case, I hope you find these useful.
